My take on https://adventofcode.com/2023/ in Go. As usual, i don't particularly
care if i provide my solutions _fast_, i try to be _correct_ on the first
answer, and care for being runtime efficient.
All puzzles are backed by unit testing the examples and the puzzles.
Results are hard coded into the unit tests, so you might not want to peek at `_test.go` files.

== Environment

- Go 1.22
- vim, vim-go, gopls, fed by an HHKB
- VisualStudio Code for debugging
- Fedora 38, 39, 40 @ Framework 16" (AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS w/ Radeon 780M Graphics)
- Fedora 38, 39, 40 @ AMD Ryzen 5 3400G on a Gigabyte B450
- OSX @ 16" Macbook Pro 2019 (Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz)

I'd love to try one of those Risc-V boards but can't decide between
https://github.com/openwch/ch32v003[a bare metal 48 MHz]
- probably requiring tinygo - or a full fledge
https://www.sifive.com/cores/performance-p870-p870a[multicore GHz monster].

== Project structure

Each day lives separately in a `day{{.n}}.go` and `day{{.n}}_test.go` file.
Unit test data, both examples and puzzle input, is in
`testdata/day{{.n}}.txt`, and `testdata/day{{.n}}_example.txt`.

== Overview

Number of tries for a correct answer:

|===
| Day | part 1 | part 2
| 1   |   1    |  3
| 2   |   1    |  1
| 3   |   3    |  2
| 4   |   1    |  1
| 5   |   1    |
| 6   |   1    |  1
| 7   |   1    |  2
| 8   |   1    |
| 9   |        |
| 10  |        |
| 11  |        |
| 12  |        |
| 13  |        |
| 14  |        |
| 15  |        |
| 16  |        |

Solving part 1 takes 55 Î¼s.

== Day 3 Gear Ratios

Looks like a flood fill, aka seed fill.
Doing my homework on the internet, lots of recursive solutions.
I personally avoid recursion, because it will blow up in your face,
right when the beeper goes on alert in the middle of deep sleep.

https://github.com/erich666/GraphicsGems/blob/master/gems/SeedFill.c[Heckbert]
has a solid looking implementation as part of his "Graphic Gems" Series in part 1, `A SEED FILL ALGORITHM`.
This one is also referenced by Wikipedia as `Span Filling`.

https://lodev.org/cgtutor/floodfill.html[Lode Vandevenne] has an interesting looking `Scanline Floodfill Algorithm With Stack (floodFillScanlineStack)`.

Then there's Windows C++ Code by https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6017/QuickFill-An-efficient-flood-fill-algorithm[John R Shaw].

http://unity3dmc.blogspot.com/2017/02/ultimate-3d-floodfill-scanline.html[This] one claims to be 1000 times faster than anything else, but looks kinda weird.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill#Walk-based_filling_(Fixed-memory_method)[Wikipedia] describes an O(1) memory `Walk-based filling (Fixed-memory method)`, but it is only valid for 4-connected, and we need 8-connected because diagonals count as well.

A version from 2007 named `A Linear-Time Constant-Space Algorithm for the Boundary Fill Problem` looks very efficient.
The pseudo-code provided is a real pseudo, as in

----
next.blockednodes:={u|dist(u,next)==1 && u.color!=black}
----

The newest publication i found is https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03366[Scan-flood Fill(SCAFF): an Efficient Automatic Precise Region Filling Algorithm for Complicated Regions] by Yixuan He, Tianyi Hu, Delu Zeng.
It mentions large scale auto-learning.

But then we would have to XOR the whole thing because we need those numbers that are reachable, not islands.
Thinking again, KISS to the rescue. Just parse numbers, and check if the C8 environment contains any special characters.

It took me three turns to make the algorithm work. Yes, numbers can end directly at the end of the line.

Part 2 contains a twitch in the particular input, which makes it possible to use an abbreviation.
Brute force approach will never terminate.
I peeked into some hints when my implementation ran longer than 10s, and decided to not apply the shortcut because it makes the solution totally dependent on input data.
