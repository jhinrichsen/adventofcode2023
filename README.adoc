My take on https://adventofcode.com/2023/ in Go. As usual, i don't particularly
care if i provide my solutions _fast_, i try to be _correct_ on the first
answer, and care for being runtime efficient.
All puzzles are backed by unit testing the examples and the puzzles.
Results are hard coded into the unit tests, so you might not want to peek at `_test.go` files.

== Environment

- Go 1.22, 1.23
- vim, vim-go, gopls, fed by an HHKB
- VisualStudio Code for debugging
- Fedora up to 41 @ Framework 16" (AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS w/ Radeon 780M Graphics)
- Fedora up to 41 @ custom build (AMD Ryzen 5 3400G on a Gigabyte B450)
- OSX @ 16" Macbook Pro 2019 (Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz)
- Prompts: Tabnine, ChatGPT, Gemini

I'd love to try one of those Risc-V boards but can't decide between
https://github.com/openwch/ch32v003[a bare metal 48 MHz]
- probably requiring tinygo - or a full fledge
https://www.sifive.com/cores/performance-p870-p870a[multicore GHz monster].

== Project structure

Each day lives separately in a `day{{.n}}.go` and `day{{.n}}_test.go` file.
Unit test data, both examples and puzzle input, is in
`testdata/day{{.n}}.txt`, and `testdata/day{{.n}}_example.txt`.

== Overview

Number of tries for a correct answer:

|===
| Day | Part 1 | Part 2
| 1   |   1    |  3
| 2   |   1    |  1
| 3   |   3    |  2
| 4   |   1    |  1
| 5   |   1    |  2
| 6   |   1    |  1
| 7   |   1    |  2
| 8   |   1    |  2
| 9   |   1    |  1
| 10  |   1    |  1
| 11  |   1    |  1
| 12  |   1    |  1
| 13  |        |
| 14  |        |

Solving part 1 takes 55 μs.

== Day 3: Gear Ratios

Looks like a flood fill, aka seed fill.
Doing my homework on the internet, lots of recursive solutions.
I personally avoid recursion, because it will blow up in your face,
right when the beeper goes on alert in the middle of deep sleep.

https://github.com/erich666/GraphicsGems/blob/master/gems/SeedFill.c[Heckbert]
has a solid looking implementation as part of his "Graphic Gems" Series in part 1, `A SEED FILL ALGORITHM`.
This one is also referenced by Wikipedia as `Span Filling`.

https://lodev.org/cgtutor/floodfill.html[Lode Vandevenne] has an interesting looking `Scanline Floodfill Algorithm With Stack (floodFillScanlineStack)`.

Then there's Windows C++ Code by https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6017/QuickFill-An-efficient-flood-fill-algorithm[John R Shaw].

http://unity3dmc.blogspot.com/2017/02/ultimate-3d-floodfill-scanline.html[This] one claims to be 1000 times faster than anything else, but looks kinda weird.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill#Walk-based_filling_(Fixed-memory_method)[Wikipedia] describes an O(1) memory `Walk-based filling (Fixed-memory method)`, but it is only valid for 4-connected, and we need 8-connected because diagonals count as well.

A version from 2007 named `A Linear-Time Constant-Space Algorithm for the Boundary Fill Problem` looks very efficient.
The pseudo-code provided is a real pseudo, as in

----
next.blockednodes:={u|dist(u,next)==1 && u.color!=black}
----

The newest publication i found is https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03366[Scan-flood Fill(SCAFF): an Efficient Automatic Precise Region Filling Algorithm for Complicated Regions] by Yixuan He, Tianyi Hu, Delu Zeng.
It mentions large scale auto-learning.

But then we would have to XOR the whole thing because we need those numbers that are reachable, not islands.
Thinking again, KISS to the rescue. Just parse numbers, and check if the C8 environment contains any special characters.

It took me three turns to make the algorithm work. Yes, numbers can end directly at the end of the line.

== Day 4: Scratchcards

=== Performance Optimization

Day 04 Part 2 was optimized to achieve zero allocations by replacing a dynamic slice with a fixed-size array.

==== Baseline (b0)

Initial implementation used dynamic slice allocation for tracking card counts:
- `ns := make([]uint, cardCount)` allocated a slice based on actual card count
- For 224 cards, this resulted in 1792 bytes (224 × 8 bytes/uint)
- Part 2 had 1 allocation per call

----

==== Optimization (b1)

Replaced dynamic slice with fixed-size stack-allocated array:
- `var ns [256]uint` uses compile-time known size
- Array allocated on stack instead of heap
- Comment documents safety: "AoC inputs have <256 cards, so this is safe"
- Loop over actual card count using `for i := range cardCount`

**Key Improvements:**

* **Part 2**: 2.08% faster (53.4µs → 52.3µs)
* **Part 2**: 100% reduction in allocations (1 → 0 allocs/op)
* **Part 2**: 100% reduction in memory (1792 B → 0 B)

The optimization achieves zero-allocation performance by leveraging compile-time knowledge about input constraints. AoC puzzle inputs have fewer than 256 cards, making a fixed-size `[256]uint` array safe. The Go compiler allocates this array on the stack rather than the heap, eliminating the dynamic allocation overhead entirely. The array uses 2048 bytes of stack space (256 × 8), but only the first `cardCount` elements are accessed.

== Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer

=== Performance Optimization

Day 05 was optimized by pre-allocating slices in parsing to reduce memory allocations.

==== Baseline (b0)

Initial implementation used dynamic slice growth with `append()` operations without capacity hints:
- `parseDay05` allocated slices without initial capacity
- Resulted in multiple reallocations as slices grew

**Key Improvements:**

* **Part 1**: 1.49% faster (65.0µs → 64.0µs), 6.91% less memory (40KB → 37KB), 3.91% fewer allocations (972 → 934)
* **Part 2**: 3.25% faster (390µs → 378µs), 1.32% less memory (247KB → 244KB), 0.50% fewer allocations (8322 → 8280)

The optimization works by eliminating repeated slice reallocations during parsing. By pre-allocating slices with appropriate capacities based on known input patterns, the Go runtime avoids multiple copy operations as slices grow. The parsing phase benefits most from this optimization, as it processes hundreds of numbers across multiple map sections.

=== Part 2

Part 2 reinterprets the seed numbers as ranges (start, length) instead of individual seeds.
This makes brute force iteration infeasible - the example has 27 seeds, but the real input has billions.

The solution uses range splitting to process entire ranges through each map layer without enumerating individual values. <1>
When a range overlaps with a map entry, it splits into:

- Unmapped portions (before and after the overlap) that pass through unchanged
- Overlapped portion that transforms to destination space

Each range tracks its Min/Max values in the current space (seed → soil → ... → location).

----
Answer: 52210644
----
<1> First attempt accumulated deltas (offset transformations) but kept ranges in seed space.
This produced answer 14209264, which was too low because the final minimum was calculated in the wrong coordinate system.

== Day 6: Wait For It

=== Performance Optimization

Day 06 was optimized by replacing brute force iteration with a mathematical solution using the quadratic formula.

==== Baseline (b0)

Initial implementation iterated through all possible hold times to count winning strategies:
- `Farther()` used a loop from 1 to t-1, testing each value
- For Part 1 (small races), this was fast
- For Part 2 (single race with t=42,686,985), this meant ~42 million iterations

----

==== Optimization (b1)

The problem is actually a quadratic equation:
- We want: `h*(t-h) > d` where h is hold time, t is total time, d is record distance
- Rearranging: `h² - h*t + d < 0`
- Use quadratic formula to find boundary points: `h = (t ± sqrt(t² - 4d)) / 2`
- Count integers strictly between the two roots

This changes the algorithm from O(n) iteration to O(1) calculation.

**Key Improvements:**

* **Part 1**: 80.3% faster (212ns → 42ns) - 5x speedup
* **Part 2**: 99.99997% faster (35.5ms → 11ns) - **3.2 million times faster!**

The optimization transforms the problem from iterating through millions of values to a single mathematical calculation. The quadratic formula gives exact boundary points, eliminating the need to test each individual hold time. Part 2's dramatic improvement (from 35 milliseconds to 11 nanoseconds) demonstrates the power of choosing the right algorithm - O(1) vs O(n) where n=42 million.

=== Part 2

Part 2 requires starting at all nodes ending with 'A' simultaneously and moving all "ghosts" in sync until ALL reach nodes ending with 'Z' at the same time.

The naive approach of simulating all ghosts step-by-step works for the example (6 steps) but would never terminate for the actual input - it would need to run for over 18 trillion steps. <1>

The solution exploits a special property of the input: each ghost's path forms a cycle with exactly one Z node at regular intervals. By finding when each ghost first reaches a Z node, we can use the Least Common Multiple (LCM) to calculate when all cycles align.

For each starting node ending in 'A':
- Follow the path until reaching a node ending in 'Z'
- Record the number of steps (cycle length)
- Calculate LCM of all cycle lengths

----
Answer: 18024643846273
----
<1> First attempt used synchronous simulation which ran >10s without completing, making it clear the input requires mathematical insight rather than brute force.

=== Performance Optimization

Day 08 was optimized by pre-allocating slices with exact capacities to reduce memory allocations.

==== Baseline (b0)

Initial implementation used dynamic slice growth without capacity hints:
- `var cycleLengths []uint` in Part 2 grew dynamically via append
- `var nodes []string` in `startNodes()` grew dynamically via append
- Part 2 resulted in 12 allocations per call

==== Optimization (b1)

Pre-allocated slices with exact capacities:
- `cycleLengths := make([]uint, 0, len(starts))` - pre-allocate for known number of starting nodes
- In `startNodes()`: count nodes first, then pre-allocate with exact capacity
- Eliminates repeated reallocation as slices grow

**Key Improvements:**

* **Part 2**: 3.11% faster (3.23ms → 3.13ms), 50% reduction in allocations (12 → 6 allocs/op)

The optimization reduces allocations by eliminating dynamic slice growth. Pre-allocating with exact capacity prevents the Go runtime from repeatedly allocating larger backing arrays and copying data as slices grow. Part 2 benefits most because it processes multiple starting nodes, each requiring cycle length tracking. The `startNodes()` optimization uses a two-pass approach: count first, then allocate exact capacity - trading a small amount of iteration overhead for predictable memory allocation.

Interesting that power mode starts about 3 x slower, but then reaches the same performance for part 2.
Looks like power saver mode is more resistent to CPU peaks, but then goes all in when required.

=== Performance Optimization (Stack Allocation)

Day 09 was further optimized by reducing array dimensions to fit within stack size limits, eliminating heap escaping.

==== Baseline (b0)

The Day09V2 implementation used a fixed-size array `var ns [DIM][DIM]int` with `DIM = 200`:
- Array size: [200][200]int = 200 × 200 × 8 bytes = 320 KB
- Exceeded typical stack frame limits, causing heap allocation
- Resulted in 1 allocation per call despite using a "fixed-size" array

----

==== Optimization (b1)

Analyzed actual input dimensions:
- 200 lines (matching original DIM)
- Maximum 21 numbers per line (much less than 200)

Reduced array to actual requirements with safety margin:
- Changed from `var ns [200][200]int` to `var ns [LINES][MAXNUMS]int`
- Where `LINES = 200` and `MAXNUMS = 30`
- New array size: [200][30]int = 200 × 30 × 8 bytes = 48 KB
- Now fits comfortably within stack limits

**Key Improvements:**

* **Part 1**: 55.83% faster (171µs → 76µs), 100% reduction in allocations and memory (320 KB → 0 B)
* **Part 2**: 62.65% faster (206µs → 77µs), 100% reduction in allocations and memory (320 KB → 0 B)

The optimization eliminates heap escaping by sizing arrays based on actual input dimensions rather than worst-case estimates. Go's compiler allocates small arrays (<64KB typically) on the stack, but large arrays escape to the heap. By reducing from 320KB to 48KB, the array now stays on the stack. This eliminates allocation overhead and improves cache locality. The analysis step (checking input dimensions) is crucial - blindly using large fixed arrays can defeat the performance benefits of avoiding dynamic allocations.

== Day 10: Pipe Maze

I prompted ChatGPT for the first example puzzle, taking around 10 iterations aggregating details.
Right down to the location of the input puzzle file, and its filename.
Plus a unit test that uses the example puzzle input.
The resulting code is pretty standard stuff, at least junior Go developer.

But then, running the tests `panic()`s.

Seems as if some structure is not properly initialized.
`LoadGridFromFile` contains solid line parser code with a twist.

        scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
        y := 0
        for scanner.Scan() {
                line := scanner.Text()
                if grid == nil { <1>
                        grid = Day10NewGrid(len(line), 0) <2>
                }
                grid.height++ <3>
                for x, char := range line {
                        grid.SetExits(x, y, string(char)) <4>
                }
                y++
        }

        return grid, scanner.Err()

Manually fixing the incorrect memory management, we get a test result.
It is not the expected 4 steps, but `with a distance of 2 steps`.

ChatGPT applies a standard BFS, and instead of counting the steps as in

----

I am trying different prompts, but cannot get ChatGPT off the BFS.
Gemini to the rescue? Not really.
The code looks a little bit more friendly, but this is just a matter of taste i guess.
Nevertheless, the result is also wrong.
Instead of 4, ChatGPT calculates 2, Gemini 6.

Although, to be honest, there's not much difference in total runtime because it is called exactly once for each step through the maze,
which gives it O(n) complexity.

=== Part 2

For part 2, the way through the maze needs to be marked so that a floodfill algorithm can be used.
Instead of copying the maze into another data structure, i want to keep track of touched cells while traversing.
The puzzle input is passed as []string, which are immutable in Go, so input type is changed from `[]string` to `[][]byte`.
While we're at it, why not memory map the puzzle input using `syscall.Mmap()`.
Then, in one sweep, use `unsafe.Slice()` to have `[]byte` pointers into the first dimension of the backing buffer.

The parameter `filename` is leaking, because it is

- passed to `os.Open()`, a file handle is returned, which is then passed to
- `syscall.Mmap()`, which may hold a back reference.

The compiler doesn`t know about `syscall.Munmap()`, so it makes sure the original string is kept unchanged.

=== Holes

Now, analyzing failing example unit tests, i see that flood fill doesn't cut it.
The examples contain _holes_, cells that are completely surrounded by the path, but still count as `outside`.
Vanilla flood fill cannot handle holes -> research.

Wikipedia mentions a
https://web.archive.org/web/20130126163405/http://geomalgorithms.com/a03-_inclusion.html[`winding number`]
Algorithm by Dan Sunday, 2001.

It works for examples #1, #2, and #4, but fails for #3.

=== ChatGPT

No matter what i prompt, i cannot make ChatGPT 4o step through the maze correctly.
It stumbles around, and usually stops near somewhere close to the border of the grid.

But when given the coordinates, it correctly determines the number of embedded cells _without generating any code_.

image::static/day10_example4_poly_tiles.png[Example #4: embedded cells]

Quite impressive. Focussing on the path through the maze:

image::static/day10_example4_poly_tiles_enclosed.png[Example #4: pipeline]

So, for the failing example #3, AOC expects 8 embedded cells.

My polygon is correct:

image::static/day10_example3_poly_tiles_enclosed.png[Example #3: pipeline]

So it seems `wnPnPoly` does not consider some edge cases we have here.
Instead of `8`, it returns `0`.

There's a newer publication from 2018, https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/projects/fast-winding-numbers/[Fast winding numbers].
But the https://github.com/libigl/libigl[implementation] for `igl::fast_winding_number` is way too much code.
I will need to find a simpler solution.
I let ChatGPT translate some code from Matlib to Go, functions `IsPointInPolygonStrict` and
`IsPointOnLine`, and a corresponding unit test, but that fails miserably.

----
--- FAIL: TestIsPointInPolygonStrict (0.00s)
    day10_chatgpt_test.go:75: Expected strictly inside points, but found none
    day10_chatgpt_test.go:77: Points strictly inside: []
FAIL
----

So i end up with generating a polygon of 13_913 ( <- proper Go notation) vertices and
ask ChatGPT to show the polygon.

image::static/tilt.png[]

So, let's just give wnPnPoly one shot, although one example fails.


image::static/day10.png[Success]

Duh.
Well, for AOC this will be fine.
Better not load that code into a Taurus.

That's 157 ms, too slow. Said flying object will move 51 m in this time.

=== Performance Optimization

Day 10 Part 2 was optimized by pre-allocating the polygon vertex slice to reduce memory allocations.

==== Baseline (b0)

Initial implementation used dynamic slice growth for tracking polygon vertices:
- `var poly []image.Point` declared without capacity
- `poly = append(poly, p)` grew the slice dynamically as the maze was traversed
- Resulted in 25 allocations for Part 2 as the slice was reallocated multiple times

----

==== Optimization (b1)

Pre-allocated polygon slice with maximum possible capacity:
- Polygon loop bounded by grid perimeter: `maxPolySize := 2 * (len(lines[0]) + len(lines))`
- Only allocate for Part 2: `if part2 { poly = make([]image.Point, 0, maxPolySize) }`
- Eliminates repeated reallocation as vertices are appended

----

**Key Improvements:**

* **Part 1**: 10.54% faster (433µs → 387µs)
* **Part 2**: 36% reduction in allocations (25 → 16 allocs/op)

**Trade-off:**
- Memory capacity increased by 15% due to pre-allocation with maximum perimeter estimate
- The actual polygon is smaller than the perimeter, so some capacity goes unused
- This is a standard optimization pattern: trading memory for fewer allocations and reduced GC pressure

The optimization reduces allocations by eliminating slice growth operations. The pre-allocated capacity (grid perimeter) is an upper bound - the actual polygon follows the pipe maze and is typically smaller. While this increases allocated capacity, it significantly reduces allocation count and associated overhead. The 9 eliminated allocations (25→16) indicate the slice was growing ~9 times during traversal.

== Day 11: Cosmos Expansion

=== Part 1

Possible alternative implementations:

- Literally expand the existing grid, and then use a line draw algo to count points. Drawback: many heap allocations
- Use Dijkstra's `shortest path` or an A* implementation, giving regular cells +1, and expanded cells +2. Drawback: runs long time.

- On further thought, we need to cross all expanded spaces exactly once when traversing from P~1~ to P~2~. Use a stright manhattan distance as a baseline, and add horizontal and vertical expanded spaces while crossing.

        }()
        ...
}

<1> parse grid to detect galaxies (`'#'`)
<2> create a unique list of galaxy pairs (1->3, 2->7, ...)

Let's see if and how ChatGPT can squeeze some performance out of this code.

* It shows alternative code that compiles, and runs, and has the same test results as before. Good.
* It also unrolls the closures into straight `for` loops. Good.

After ChatGPTs suggestions:

----

Runtime down by 50%, garbage collection down close to nothing, 39 allocations down to 10.

However, it does not seem to know about Go's new `range` operator, it unrolls the loop, which should not have any performance impact.

[source, diff]
----
-       for x := range dimX {
+       for x := 0; x < dimX; x++ {
----

It also changes what i consider idiomatic Go code, a zero slice and `append()` operations, to

[source, diff]
----
- var points []image.Point
+ points := []image.Point{}
----

There's two more little improvements.
- Two counter, one for the number of points between galaxies, and one for the total, can be combined.
- Using the expanded step count `1` and not the more human readable `'1'`.

=== Part 2

No changes other than the introduction of a factor.
Same O(n) as part 1, so same performance.

== Day 12: Hot Springs

=== Part 1

Using a ChatGPT prompt to generate the `validate` function, which checks if one line of input has
- the correct syntax (format), and
- correct semantics, i.e. it is well formed with regard to the checksum.

The generated code does not compile.

==== Error #1

The loop value variable `cs` shadows the outer checksum list, and cannot be assigned to.

----
	cs := make([]int, len(csParts)) <1>
	for i, cs := range csParts { <2>
		...
		cs[i] = val <3>
	}
----
<1> allocate a list of checksums
<2> iterate comma separated checksums
<3> assign to the loop var `cs` which shadows the outer `cs` list

==== Error #2

The regular expression is invalid.

----
	re := regexp.MustCompile(`#++`) <1>
----
<1> not a valid regexp in Go

which leads to

----
panic: regexp: Compile(`#++`): error parsing regexp: invalid nested repetition operator: `++` [recovered]
----

When asked if `#++` is a valid regular expression, ChatGPT reports

----
To clarify:

    In Go (and many other regex engines), the regular expression #++ means "match one or more # characters", but this expression can be simplified to #+ (the ++ is redundant and unnecessary).
    The + quantifier matches one or more of the preceding element (in this case, the # symbol).

Thus, the correct and simpler expression to match one or more consecutive # characters is:

    #+
----

Again one of those cases, if you know what you are doing, you can lead ChatGPT to the right result.

==== Error #3

One of the table driven tests is correct, but assumed to fail.

----
		{".###.# 3,1", false},            // Invalid checksum
----

==== Error #4

When introducing multiple lines of input, unit tests get foobar.
Marking those as broken, and focusing on the AOC example.

NOTE: These are all easy fixes, but they need to be fixed.

Last but not least, we have a valid solution for part 1, which has `7645760` combinations.

We can see that the payload is starting to eat our resources, not GC/ runtime, which is a good thing.

==== Performance tweak #2: streamline `generateCombinations`

Renamed to `permute`.
Instead of slaying strings, we determine how much combinations we have, and copy the original `string` N times as a modifyable `[][]byte`.
Then, using a period length generator, we toggle high and low values and let them trickle columnwise into place.

Think "Matrix".

Compared to the AI generated code, we're down in all categories by a factor between 11 and 16.
Instead of cloud based CPU costs of one million $, that's just $ 62.500.

==== Performance tweak #3: Dynamic Programming with Memoization

While the permutation approach works for Part 1, it becomes infeasible for Part 2 where inputs are unfolded 5x.
A pattern with 15 wildcards becomes 2^15 = 32,768 combinations, but unfolded becomes 2^75+ combinations - impossible to enumerate.

The solution: dynamic programming with memoization.
Instead of generating all possible arrangements, we recursively explore valid placements while caching results for identical subproblems.
The state space is (position, group_index, group_length), which is much smaller than the exponential number of combinations.

This approach also benefits Part 1, even though brute force permutation was fast enough.

The DP approach is:
- **138x faster** for Part 1 (622ms → 4.5ms)
- **114x less memory** for Part 1 (629 MiB → 5.5 MiB)
- **1604x fewer allocations** for Part 1 (15.3M → 9.5k)
- Makes Part 2 tractable without RAM explosion

Final performance: Part 1 runs in ~5ms, Part 2 in ~73ms.
