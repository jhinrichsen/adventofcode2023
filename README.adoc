My take on https://adventofcode.com/2023/ in Go. As usual, i don't particularly
care if i provide my solutions _fast_, i try to be _correct_ on the first
answer, and care for being runtime efficient.
Most, if not all, puzzles are backed by unit testing the examples, and by some
benchmarks.

Expected results are hard coded into the unit tests, so unless you are peeking
for a solution avoid looking at those.
