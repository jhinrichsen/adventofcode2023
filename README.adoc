Same procedure as every year, Eric.

My take on https://adventofcode.com/2023/ in Go. As usual, i don't particularly
care if i provide my solutions _fast_, i try to be _correct_ on the first
answer, and care for being runtime efficient.
Most, if not all, puzzles are backed by unit testing the examples, and by some
benchmarks.

Expected results are hard coded into the unit tests, so unless you are peeking
for a solution avoid looking at those.

== Environment

- Go 1.21.3
- vim, vim-go, gopls, fed by an HHKB
- VisualStudio Code for complex debugging scenarios
- Fedora 38 @ AMD Ryzen 5 3400G on a Gigabyte B450
- OSX @ 16" Macbook Pro 2019

I'd love to try one of those Risc-V boards but can't decide between
https://github.com/openwch/ch32v003[a bare metal 48 MHz]
- probably requiring tinygo - or a full fledge
https://www.sifive.com/cores/performance-p870-p870a[multicore GHz monster].

== Project structure

Each day lives separately in a `day{{.n}}.go` and `day{{.n}}_test.go` file.
Unit test data, both examples and puzzle input, is in
`testdata/day{{.n}}.txt`, and `testdata/day{{.n}}_example.txt`.

== Overview

Number of tries for a correct answer:
