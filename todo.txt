### Refactor: Puzzle types should be arrays/slices themselves

Review all DayXXPuzzle types to check if they can be the slice/array directly instead of wrapper structs.

**Pattern to check:**
```go
// BEFORE (wrapper struct - may be unnecessary)
type DayXXPuzzle struct {
    items []SomeType
}

// AFTER (direct type - cleaner)
type DayXXPuzzle []SomeType
```

**Completed:**
- [x] Day 18 - Changed to direct slice type

**Note:** Only refactor if it makes sense - some puzzles may legitimately need struct wrappers if they have multiple fields that aren't just a single collection.
